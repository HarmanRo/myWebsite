        <h2>What got me intrested into Web Development:</h2>
        <p>Back in my highschool years I was always amazed by the interactive websites our teacher provided us to learn. I would wonder how any of them where created, I'd always assume a software developer created it using code. At the time I didn't really know what code was or how to learn it. I never bothered to look it up either. However, a couple months ago I had came across an article on google regarding web development. I never knew web development was a career path. The article as a recall gave a breif description of what an web developer does and after reading I soon relized my whole conception of a software engineer was wrong. So I began to do more research and began to watch a whole bunch of youtube video to soon find out that there are multiple paths a software developer could take. My reasearching then brought me to teamtreehouse where I began my journey of becoming a web developer.</p>
