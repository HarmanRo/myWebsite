            <h1>About me...</h1>
            <h2>What got me intrested into Web Development:</h2>
            <p>Back in my highschool years I was always amazed by the interactive websites our teacher provided us to learn with. I would wonder how they where created, I'd always assume a software developer created it using code. At the time I didn't really know what code was or how to learn it. I never bothered to look it up either. However, a couple months ago I had came across an article on google regarding web development. I never knew web development was a career path. The article as a recall gave a breif description of what a web developer does. After reading I soon relized my whole conception of a software engineer was wrong. So I began to do more research and began to watch a whole bunch of youtube video to soon find out that there are multiple paths a software developer can take. My reasearching then brought me to teamtreehouse where I began my own journey of becoming a web developer.</p>
            <h2>My hobbies:</h2>
            <h3>The Gym:</h3>
            <p>I love working out when I have the time. Some of my favorite excersices are the squat, the bench, and the deadlift. Also, know as the big three compound movements.</p>
            <h3>Gaming:</h3>
